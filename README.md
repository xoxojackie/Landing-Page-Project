# Landing Page

This is a simple landing page website, made for an assignment issued in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It utilizes HTML and CSS, and particularly CSS flexbox. 

It was a fun exercise. I didn't find it particularly challenging, although I did find flexbox difficult to grasp when I first started learning it. Coding along with exercises, and lots of silly practice pages, helped me get a grasp on it. So by the time I got to this assignment I felt like a pro.
